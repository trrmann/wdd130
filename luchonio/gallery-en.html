                <img class="card-img" src="images/grupal.png" alt="Bebop Crew">
                <p>In this drawing we can see the bebop crew of the animated Japanese Cowboy bebop.  Being a fan of this art, Luchonio took the liberty of adapting the animation designs to his drawing style.  In general, Luchonio used more vivid colors for the background as in the characters to be able to distance himself a little more from the original designs and give them a more personal touch.</p>

                  <p>Buttercup drawing which Luchonio made as part of a challenge on social networks.  Which, consisted of drawing the character of the animated series for children "Powerpuff girls", in his drawing style, in one of the most memorable poses of this television series.  He wanted to respect the original design as much as he could, since it is an animated series of which he is a big fan and had watched it when he was a child.</p>

                <p>This is a drawing of the character of Gwen from "Total Drama".  In which, Luchonio wanted to give the sensation of sensuality with the pose of the character and at the same time place a detailed background and according to the tone of the animated series.  Which, is a reality show in a island where the interviews with the participants take place in the bathrooms.</p>

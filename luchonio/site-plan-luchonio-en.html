    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <h3>Purpose</h3>
    <p>This website is intended to function as an artistic portfolio in such a way that it shows the services and works offered by Luchonio as a personal brand, which specializes in cartoon drawings. The services offered range from character creation to logo designs, all always hand in hand with the client, in turn also seeking to publicize some personal comic and animation projects that are being developed in the future.</p>

    <h3>Audience</h3>
    <p>Adults, between 20 and 35 years old, who are looking for an art style that resembles the series they saw in their childhood and at the same time follows current trends through a cartoon style. In addition, it is aimed at those who seek to graph any idea they have, be it from a logo, comic, character design; and turn the stories they have in mind into reality in order to make them known to the public either through social networks or in print.</p>

        <p>In this drawing we can see the bebop crew of the animated Japanese Cowboy bebop.  Being a fan of this art, Luchonio took the liberty of adapting the animation designs to his drawing style.  In general, Luchonio used more vivid colors for the background as in the characters to be able to distance himself a little more from the original designs and give them a more personal touch.</p>
        <p>Buttercup drawing which Luchonio made as part of a challenge on social networks.  Which, consisted of drawing the character of the animated series for children "Powerpuff girls", in his drawing style, in one of the most memorable poses of this television series.  He wanted to respect the original design as much as he could, since it is an animated series of which he is a big fan and had watched it when he was a child.</p>
        <p>This is a drawing of the character of Gwen from "Total Drama".  In which, Luchonio wanted to give the sensation of sensuality with the pose of the character and at the same time place a detailed background and according to the tone of the animated series.  Which, is a reality show in a island where the interviews with the participants take place in the bathrooms.</p>

        <p>Ambarine "knuckles witch" ðŸ‘Š is a character of Luchonio's friend <a href="https://www.instagram.com/danigrex2n/">danigrex2n</a>, who is a fighter in a world full of magic and fantasy.  In this drawing, he redesigned her character to better adapt to the cartoon-type drawing style that he uses.  Being a character who likes fights, he had to draw her in a pose that would show all her personality.</p>
        <p>ðŸŒŒ Vanessa Misterio ðŸŒŒ this drawing is the portrait of his friend Vanessa's character.  Who is a kind of angelic being.  In this drawing the colors of the wings in violet and white stand out a lot and the wings contrast very well with the background.</p>
        <p>ðŸ‘» The dark Evelyne ðŸ˜±, is a character from the webcomic with the same name "The dark Evelyne" created by @inksowl_comics.  Which, is about a girl who can see ghosts and demonic entities.  Luchonio made this drawing as part of a theme launched on social networks by the same author and creator of the character.  This consisted of drawing his character in your own way with a terrifying background.  Personally, Luchonio love's the design of this character which has a somewhat gothic theme.. This was one of Luchonio's first works with a cartoon style.</p>
        <p>This is a drawing of Asajj Ventress.  Which, is a character from the clone wars series that belongs to the Star Wars franchise that Luchonio is a huge fan of.  In this case he combined 2 character designs taking into account their appearance in both series.  He also chose to place her in a fighting pose as she is some kind of Sith lord.</p>
        <p>This is fan art of the horror video game Poppy Playtime.  Representing the character Mommy long legs which, is a kind of giant toy.  This characters main characteristic is to be able to lengthen its extremities in an exaggerated way in order to catch its victims. This time Luchonio wanted to try something different and start drawing creatures.</p>
        <p>This drawing of Batman is inspired by The Batman movie.  In this drawing, Luchonio wanted to play a little with the lights and the dark and brown tones in the batman armor.  In turn, the background is made up of debris and water that runs all over the same.</p>

In this drawing, he redesigned her character to better adapt to the cartoon-type drawing style that he uses.  Being a character who likes fights, he had to draw her in a pose that would show all her personality.</p>

Which, is about a girl who can see ghosts and demonic entities.  Luchonio made this drawing as part of a theme launched on social networks by the same author and creator of the character.  This consisted of drawing his character in your own way with a terrifying background.  Personally, Luchonio love's the design of this character which has a somewhat gothic theme.. This was one of Luchonio's first works with a cartoon style.</p>
